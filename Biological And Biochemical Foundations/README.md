# Biological And Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems

------



**AAMC Description**

The Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems section asks you to solve problems by combining your knowledge of biological and biochemical concepts with your scientific inquiry and reasoning skills. This section tests processes that are unique to living organisms, such as growing and reproducing, maintaining a constant internal environment, acquiring materials and energy, sensing and responding to environmental changes, and adapting. It also tests how cells and organ systems within an organism act independently and in concert to accomplish these processes, and it asks you to reason about these processes at various levels of biological organization within a living system.



**Disciplines**

First-Semester Biochemistry (25%)

Introductory Biology (65%)

General Chemistry (5%)

Organic Chemistry (5%)



**Foundational Concepts**

Foundational Concept **1 (55%)**: Biomolecules have unique properties that determine how they contribute to the structure and function of cells and how they participate in the processes necessary to maintain life.

Foundational Concept **2 (20%)**: Highly organized assemblies of molecules, cells, and organs interact to carry out the functions of living organisms.

Foundational Concept **3 (25%)**: Complex systems of tissues and organs sense the internal and external environments of multicellular organisms, and through integrated functioning, maintain a stable internal environment within an ever-changing external environment.
