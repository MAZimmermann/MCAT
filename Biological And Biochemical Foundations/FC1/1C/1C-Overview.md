# Transmission of heritable information from generation to generation and the processes that increase genetic diversity

------

**AAMC Description**

The information necessary to direct life functions is contained within discrete nucleotide sequences transmitted from generation to generation by mechanisms that, by nature of their various processes, provide the raw materials for evolution by increasing genetic diversity. Specific sequences of deoxyribonucleic acids store and transfer the heritable information necessary for the continuation of life from one generation to the next. These sequences, called genes ― being part of longer DNA molecules ― are organized, along with various proteins, into biomolecular assemblies called chromosomes.

Chromosomes pass from parents to offspring in sexually reproducing organisms. The processes of meiosis and fertilization maintain a species’ chromosome count during the sexual life cycle. Because parents pass on discrete heritable units that retain their separate identities in offspring, the laws of probability can be used to predict the outcome of some, but not all, genetic crosses.

The behavior of chromosomes during meiosis and fertilization is responsible for most of the genetic variation that arises each generation. Mechanisms that contribute to this genetic variation include independent assortment of chromosomes, crossing over, and random fertilization. Other mechanisms, such as mutation, random genetic drift, bottlenecks, and immigration, exist with the potential to affect the genetic diversity of individuals and populations. Collectively, the genetic diversity that results from these processes provides the raw material for evolution by natural selection.

The content in this category covers the mechanisms by which heritable information is transmitted from generation to generation and the evolutionary processes that generate and act on genetic variation.
