# Principles of bioenergetics and fuel molecules

------

**AAMC Description**

Living things harness energy from fuel molecules in a controlled manner that sustains all the processes responsible for maintaining life. Cell maintenance and growth is energetically costly. Cells harness the energy stored in fuel molecules, such as carbohydrates and fatty acids, and convert it into smaller units of chemical potential known as adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

The hydrolysis of ATP provides a ready source of energy for cells that can be coupled to other chemical processes that make them thermodynamically favorable. Fuel molecule mobilization, transport, and storage are regulated according to the needs of the organism.

The content in this category covers the principles of bioenergetics and fuel molecule catabolism. Details of oxidative phosphorylation including the role of chemiosmotic coupling and biological electron transfer reactions are covered, as are the general features of fatty acid and glucose metabolism. Additionally, regulation of these metabolic pathways, fuel molecule mobilization, transport, and storage are covered.
