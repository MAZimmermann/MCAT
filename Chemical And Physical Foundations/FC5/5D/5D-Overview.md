# 5D: Structure, function, and reactivity of biologically relevant molecules

------

**AAMC Description**

The structure of biological molecules forms the basis of their chemical reactions including oligomerization and polymerization. Unique aspects of each type of biological molecule dictate their role in living systems, whether providing structure or information storage or serving as fuel and catalysts.

The content in this category covers the structure, function, and reactivity of biologically relevant molecules including the mechanistic considerations that dictate their modes of reactivity.
