# 5E: Principles of chemical thermodynamics and kinetics

------

**AAMC Description**

The processes that occur in living systems are dynamic, and they follow the principles of chemical thermodynamics and kinetics. The position of chemical equilibrium is dictated by the relative energies of products and reactants. The rate at which chemical equilibrium is attained is dictated by a variety of factors: concentration of reactants, temperature, and the amount of catalyst (if any).

Biological systems have evolved to harness energy and use it in very efficient ways to support all processes of life, including homeostasis and anabolism. Biological catalysts, known as enzymes, have evolved that allow all the relevant chemical reactions required to sustain life to occur both rapidly and efficiently and under the narrow set of conditions required.

The content in this category covers all principles of chemical thermodynamics and kinetics including enzymatic catalysis.
