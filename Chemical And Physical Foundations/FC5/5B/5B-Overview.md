# 5B: Nature of molecules and intermolecular interactions

------

**AAMC Description**

Covalent bonding involves the sharing of electrons between atoms. If the result of such interactions is not a network solid, then the covalently bonded substance will be discrete and molecular.

The shape of molecules can be predicted based on electrostatic principles and quantum mechanics since only two electrons can occupy the same orbital. Bond polarity (both direction and magnitude) can be predicted based on knowledge of the valence electron structure of the constituent atoms. The strength of intermolecular interactions depends on molecular shape and the polarity of the covalent bonds present. The solubility and other physical properties of molecular substances depend on the strength of intermolecular interactions.

The content in this category covers the nature of molecules and includes covalent bonding, molecular structure, nomenclature, and intermolecular interactions.
