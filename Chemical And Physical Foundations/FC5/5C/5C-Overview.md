# 5C: Separation and purification methods

------

**AAMC Description**

Analysis of complex mixtures of substances ― especially biologically relevant materials ― typically requires separation of the components. Many methods have been developed to accomplish this task, and the method used is dependent on the types of substances which comprise the mixture. All these methods rely on the magnification of potential differences in the strength of intermolecular interactions.

The content in this category covers separation and purification methods including extraction, liquid and gas chromatography, and electrophoresis.
