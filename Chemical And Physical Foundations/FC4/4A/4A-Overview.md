# 4A: Translational motion, forces, work, energy, and equilibrium in living systems

------

**AAMC Description**

The motion of any object can be described in terms of displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Objects accelerate when subjected to external forces and are at equilibrium when the net force and the net torque acting on them are zero. Many aspects of motion can be calculated with the knowledge that energy is conserved, even though it may be converted into different forms. In a living system, the energy for motion comes from the metabolism of fuel molecules, but the energetic requirements remain subject to the same physical principles.

The content in this category covers several physics topics relevant to living systems including translational motion, forces, work, energy, and equilibrium.
