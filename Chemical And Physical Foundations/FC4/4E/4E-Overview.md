# 4E: Atoms, nuclear decay, electronic structure, and atomic chemical behavior

------

**AAMC Description**

Atoms are classified by their atomic number: the number of protons in the atomic nucleus, which also includes neutrons. Chemical interactions between atoms are the result of electrostatic forces involving the electrons and the nuclei. Because neutrons are uncharged, they do not dramatically affect the chemistry of any particular type of atom, but they do affect the stability of the nucleus itself.

When a nucleus is unstable, decay results from one of several different processes, which are random but occur at well-characterized average rates. The products of nuclear decay (alpha, beta, and gamma rays) can interact with living tissue, breaking chemical bonds and ionizing atoms and molecules in the process.

The electronic structure of an atom is responsible for its chemical and physical properties. Only discrete energy levels are allowed for electrons. These levels are described individually by quantum numbers. Since the outermost, or valence, electrons are responsible for the strongest chemical interactions, a description of these electrons alone is a good first approximation to describe the behavior of any particular type of atom.

Mass spectrometry is an analytical tool that allows characterization of atoms or molecules based on well-recognized fragmentation patterns and the charge-to-mass ratio (m/z) of ions generated in the gas phase.

The content in this category covers atomic structure, nuclear decay, electronic structure, and the periodic nature of atomic chemical behavior.
