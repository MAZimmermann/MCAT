# 4D: How light and sound interact with matter

------

**AAMC Description**

Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation — waves of electric and magnetic fields that transmit energy. The behavior of light depends on its frequency (or wavelength). The properties of light are used in the optical elements of the eye to focus rays of light on sensory elements. When light interacts with matter, spectroscopic changes occur that can be used to identify the material on an atomic or molecular level. Differential absorption of electromagnetic radiation can be used to generate images useful in diagnostic medicine. Interference and diffraction of light waves are used in many analytical and diagnostic techniques. The photon model of light explains why electromagnetic radiation of different wavelengths interacts differently with matter.

When mechanical energy is transmitted through solids, liquids, and gases, oscillating pressure waves known as “sound” are generated. Sound waves are audible if the sensory elements of the ear vibrate in response to exposure to these vibrations. The detection of reflected sound waves is used in ultrasound imaging. This noninvasive technique readily locates dense subcutaneous structures, such as bone and cartilage, and is very useful in diagnostic medicine.

The content in this category covers the properties of both light and sound and how these energy waves interact with matter.
