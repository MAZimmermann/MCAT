This repository is simply meant to serve as a one-stop shop for viewing foundational concepts and topics tested on the MCAT, as opposed to sifting through pages and pages on the AAMC website.



The README.MD file in each section contains the full list of the relevant foundational concepts and topics for that section. The lists were pulled directly from the AAMC website (July 2022).
