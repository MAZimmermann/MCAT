This repository is simply meant to serve as a one-stop shop for viewing foundational concepts and topics tested on the MCAT, as opposed to sifting through pages and pages on the AAMC website.



The README.MD file in each section contains the full list of the relevant foundational concepts and topics for that section. The lists were pulled directly from the AAMC website (July 2022).



Topic Breakdown:

**Foundational Concept 1**

**1A**. Structure and function of proteins and their constituent amino acids.

**1B**. Transmission of genetic information from the gene to the protein.

**1C**. Transmission of heritable information from generation to generation and the processes that increase genetic diversity.

**1D**. Principles of bioenergetics and fuel molecule metabolism.

**Foundational Concept 2**

**2A**.  Assemblies of molecules, cells, and groups of cells within single cellular and multicellular organisms.

**2B**. The structure, growth, physiology, and genetics of prokaryotes and viruses.

**2C**. Processes of cell division, differentiation, and specialization.

**Foundational Concept 3**

**3A**.  Structure and functions of the nervous and endocrine systems and ways these systems coordinate the organ systems.

**3B**. Structure and integrative functions of the main organ systems.

**Foundational Concept 4**

**4A**. Translational motion, forces, work, energy, and equilibrium in living systems.

**4B**.  Importance of fluids for the circulation of blood, gas movement, and gas exchange.

**4C**. Electrochemistry and electrical circuits and their elements.

**4D**. How light and sound interact with matter.

**4E**. Atoms, nuclear decay, electronic structure, and atomic chemical behavior.

**Foundational Concept 5**

**5A**. Unique nature of water and its solutions.

**5B**. Nature of molecules and intermolecular interactions.

**5C**. Separation and purification methods.

**5D**. Structure, function, and reactivity of biologically relevant molecules.
